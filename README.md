# Image Encryption & Decryption Web App

This web application allows users to upload images for encryption and decryption. The app processes the uploaded image, applies a manipulation (encryption or decryption), and then displays both the original and manipulated images. Users can also download the processed images directly from the app.

## Features:
- Image Upload: Users can upload an image for encryption or decryption.
- Image Encryption/Decryption: The app performs encryption or decryption on the uploaded image.
- preview: After processing, both the original and the manipulated images are displayed in a side-by-side view.
- Download Option: Users can download the processed (encrypted/decrypted) images.


## Technologies Used:
- Flask: A lightweight Python web framework for building the web app.
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the front-end.
- Bootstrap: For responsive design and UI components.
- Python: For image manipulation logic.
- Base64: For encoding and decoding images to display in the browser.
